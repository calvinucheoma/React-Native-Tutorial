A <View> component only takes up the space offered by its children.
To make the <View> component to take up the entire space, we have to give it a 'flex:1' style property.
In React Native, all text nodes must be wrapped inside a <Text> component.
The <Button> component in React Native is a self-closing tag.
We wrap <Pressable> component around elements to detect press interaction.
We can create a custom button using the <Pressable> component.
It has some other props like 'onPressIn' which is called when a press is activated.
'onLongPress' which is triggered when a press is held for longer than 500 milliseconds.
'onPressOut' is called when the press gesture is deactivated.
For <Modal> components, the 'onRequestClose' handler prop is triggered when the user presses the 'back' button 
on android or dismisses the modal with a gesture on ios.
'presentationStyle' prop only affects ios and not android.
The 'backgroundColor' prop on the <StatusBar/> component works for only android devices.
'barStyle="default"' corresponds to white text on android and black text on ios.
'hidden' prop hides the StatusBar
<ActivityIndicator> component displays a circular loading indicator. The 'animating' prop hides this component when set to false
React Native does not use css for styling, but rather it uses Javascript
