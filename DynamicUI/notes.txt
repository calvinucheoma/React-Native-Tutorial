The purpose of <SafeAreaView> is to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device. 
It applies padding to reflect the physical limitations of the screen such as rounded corners or camera notches.
This is mostly for ios devices with notches at the top of the screen.

We can specify styles and other codes for android and ios devices separately by using the '.android' and '.ios' extensions
to name our .js files. Then, when we import this file into our App component, we do not specify he extension. React native
automatically renders the styles for the different platforms based on the file extension name
